Web audio fast fourrier transform

This connects to your mic and shows the spectum analysis of the sounds that are detected. The frequency has a log-scale, and amplitude is linear.

Note: this requires permission to use your microphone so might not work in some privacy-centric browsers such as DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus.
